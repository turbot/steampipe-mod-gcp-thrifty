# GCP Thrifty Mod

Be Thrifty on GCP! This mod checks for unused resources and opportunities to optimize your spend on GCP.

## References

[GCP](https://cloud.google.com) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. 

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.
